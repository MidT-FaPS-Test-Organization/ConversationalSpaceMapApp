    <b>Conversational Space Map</b>
    <p>
        Mapping and analysing the conversations that make up interviews can help you engage reflexively with your own interviewing practice, in particular, your questioning and listening and relationship with the participants. She proposes using a conversational space map to represent the pattern of interactions betweenthe interviewer and participant, providing an overview of the interview dynamics within which more detailed analysis of your practice can be undertaken. Subsequent analysis of the interview transcript and the audio-visual or audio recording can help identify the actual reasons for these patterns and highlight potential issues. Each conversational space map represents visually the number of words in each utterance made by the interviewer and interviewee for an entire interview. It can be used to highlight the different interaction patterns between you as interviewer and the participant.In Figure 10.3 the interview starts (at the bottom of the 'map') with a short-short pattern where the interviewer is collecting demographic data. Where this pattern continues, it can suggest the interviewer is finding it difficult establish flow or the participant is refusing to engage. This is followed by a long-long interaction where the interviewer puts their question in context. Such patterns where they continue can indicate that the interview is an exchange of ideas which may not be the purpose of the interview. The series of short-long interactions occur as the interviewer elicits answers through follow-up questions; often considered the ideal for interviews. The next interaction is a long-short interaction where the participant was reluctant to answer. This pattern, where it continues, can also indicate the interviewer is telling the participant too much about their own views and dominating the interview. After further interactions long-long and short-long interactions, the latter comprising follow-up questions, the interview closes with a series of short-short interactions.

    <b>Using a conversational space map </b>
    <p>
        Sophia had decided to use semi-structured thematic interviews. Prior to collecting data, she undertook, and video recorded a pilot interview using Zoom cloud-based video conferencing. Having reflected upon what she had said to the participant and her use of paralinguistic signals and visual cues she. decided to examine the pattern of interaction with her participant, creating a Conversational Space Map of their interactional practice. This revealed that, although the participant spoke more than Sophia did, there were parts of the interview where she dominated the conversation. Looking at the first half of her interview, she felt her first few lengthy utterances were easily stified as she was explaining her study, reading the nfidentiality statement, and asking demographic questions, which did not require lengthy answers. For the remainder of the interview, although there were places where her participant gave a longer response, Sophia felt she was talking too much. In contrast her participant was offering very short answers.Sophia decided to re-examine the interview recording and transcript to try and understand why this might be. Shenoticed some of the questions she asked were vague and she had needed to clarify what she wished to know to the participant by asking supplementary questions. She also noted that although she had asked several closed questions that the participant had answered very briefly, her participant often seemed unwilling to elaborate on the answers given. She decided she needed to review the questions outlined on her interview checklist and think more carefully about her use of closed and open questions as well as how each could be phrased more precisely so her participants could better understand them and be encouraged to give fuller answers.
