    <h3>Conversational Space Map</h3>
    <p>
        A Conversational Space Map visually represents the interaction between an interviewer and a participant, helping the interviewer reflect on their behavior during the interviews afterward. By mapping the number of words by utterance, the map provides an overview of the interviewâ€™s flow, revealing patterns such as when conversation stalls or one party dominates. These maps can highlight issues with vague questions leading to brief answers from the participant or dominance by the interviewer in the interaction. By examining these maps alongside transcripts, interviewers can identify areas for improvement in the questionnaire, ensuring engaging interviews that deliver more detailed insights.
